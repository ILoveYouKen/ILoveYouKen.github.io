**BIRD: Big data Regression for predicting DNase I hypersensitivity**

>**Overview**: BIRD is a software to predict DNase I hypersensitivity (DNase-seq signal) based on gene expression data (support both human exon array and RNA-seq data). Using a pre-built model and input gene expression data, BIRD is capable to predict DNase-seq signal genome-wide (~1M genomic loci). BIRD provided two types of outputs: (1) data matrix format or (2) WIG format. Users can easily visualize the predicted DNase-seq signals in UCSC genome browser.

>BIRD is available [here](https://github.com/WeiqiangZhou/BIRD).

**PDDB: Predicted DNase I hypersensitivity database**

>**Overview**: PDDB is a database of DNase I hypersensitivity profiles for thousands of biological samples predicted based on gene expression. 

>PDDB is available [here](http://jilab.biostat.jhsph.edu/~bsherwo2/bird/index.php).
